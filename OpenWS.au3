	All script by Trey Gonsoulin unless otherwise noted.

	--- NOTES ---
	This is the au3 to run for simply opening CMW. The actual function is in
	Header.au3, so as long as you have that included in a script, you can call
	it from anywhere, this is just a run-file.

#comments-end

#include <Header.au3>

_OpenWS()
_OpenApp("trak")
